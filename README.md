This repository contains a prototype scaffold for the Noeia UI (React + TypeScript + Vite).

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

npm run dev
```

What’s included

- Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold
- Basic ESLint config
- App shell with routing and screens (Home, Calendar, Patients, Session Notes, Billing, Insights, Settings)
- Simple design tokens in `src/styles/tokens.css`

Next steps
